			Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br>
			As <mark>far</mark> as <mark>possible</mark>, without surrender, be on <mark>good</mark> terms with all persons. <br><br>
			Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others <br>
			Even to the <mark>dull</mark> and the <mark>ignorant</mark>, they too have their story. <br><br>
			Avoid <mark>loud</mark> and <mark>aggressive</mark> persons, they are <mark>vexations</mark> to the spirit. <br>
			If you compare yourself with others, you may become <mark>vain</mark> or <mark>bitter</mark> <br>
			For always there will be <mark>greater</mark> and <mark>lesser</mark> persons than yourself. <br><br>
			Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br>
			Keep <mark>interested</mark> in your own career, however <mark>humble</mark>. <br>
			It is a <mark>real</mark> possession in the changing fortunes of time. <br><br>
			Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is <mark>full</mark> of trickery. <br> 
			But let this not blind you to what virtue there is. <br>
			Many persons strive for <mark>high</mark> ideals, and everywhere life is <mark>full</mark> of heroism. <br><br>
			Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection, neither be <mark>cynical</mark> about love. <br>
			For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as <mark>perennial</mark> as the grass. <br><br>
			Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. <br><br>
			Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. <br>
			But do not distress yourself with <mark>dark</mark> imaginings. <br>
			Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. <br><br>
			Beyond a <mark>wholesome</mark> discipline, be <mark>gentle</mark> with yourself. <br>
			You are a child of the universe, no <mark>less</mark> than the trees and the stars. <br>
			You have a right to be here. <br><br>
			And whether or not it is <mark>clear</mark> to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>
			Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be. <br>
			And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the <mark>noisy</mark> confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. <br>
			With all its sham, drudgery, and <mark>broken</mark> dreams, it is still a <mark>beautiful</mark> world. <br>
			Be <mark>cheerful</mark>. Strive to be <mark>happy</mark>.
