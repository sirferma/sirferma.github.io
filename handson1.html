			Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br>
			As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. <br><br>
			Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others <br>
			Even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. <br><br>
			Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. <br>
			If you compare yourself with others, you may become bitter and dull <br>
			For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. <br><br>
			Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. <br>
			Keep interested in your own career, however humble. <br>
			It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. <br><br>
			Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. <br> 
			But let this not blind you to what virtue there is. <br>
			Many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. <br><br>
			Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection, neither be cynical about love. <br>
			For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass. <br><br>
			Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. <br><br>
			Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. <br>
			But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. <br>
			Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. <br><br>
			Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. <br>
			You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. <br>
			You have a right to be here. <br><br>
			And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>
			Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be. <br>
			And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. <br>
			With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. <br>
			Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.
